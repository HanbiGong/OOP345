I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I learned how to handle dynamic memory in C++ with the ProteinDatabase and TimedTask classes. A key point of this workshop was understanding the difference between copying and moving data. Copying means making a complete duplicate of an object, which can take a lot of time, especially with big data. For example, in the ProteinDatabase class, the copy constructor and copy assignment operator create new memory and copy each string, which is slower.

Moving data is faster because it just moves the data's ownership without making a copy. In ProteinDatabase, the move constructor and move assignment operator simply change the pointers and set the source object's pointers to nullptr. This is considered in the operator=(ProteinDatabase&& other) noexcept function, where it just reassigns the pointers instead of copying the data.

I had some trouble managing file input and making sure there were no memory leaks. But by being careful with memory allocation and using smart pointers, I solved these problems. This workshop helped me understand how to manage resources better and showed me how move operations can make my code run faster.
